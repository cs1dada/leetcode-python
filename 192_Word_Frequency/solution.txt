Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

- words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
- Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
- Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

For example, assume that words.txt has the following content:

the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is

Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
====================================================================================
solution:
cat words.txt | tr -s ' ' '\n'| sort | uniq -c | sort -r | awk '{print $2, $1}'

deltail solutin:
tr -s: truncate the string with target string, but only remaining one instance (e.g. multiple whitespaces)

the
day
is
sunny
the
the
the
sunny
is
is

sort: To make the same string successive so that uniq could count the same string fully and correctly.

day
is
is
is
sunny
sunny
the
the
the
the

uniq -c: uniq is used to filter out the repeated lines which are successive, -c means counting

      1 day
      3 is
      2 sunny
      4 the

sort -r: -r means sorting in descending order

      4 the
      3 is
      2 sunny
      1 day

awk '{ print $2, $1 }': To format the output, see here.

the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
